Georgetown Data Science Certificate Program Project (Organization: Georgetown Data Analytics (CCPE))

Cohort 10

Capstone Project for Data Science Certificate Program at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.

The objective of this project is to predict the amount of almond yield based on temperature, precipitation, and demographics data. The data consisted of almond production variables and price, weather data (monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature), and census data. Several regression models were trained over subsets of collected data from the years 1980 to 2015 in order to predict almond yield.
